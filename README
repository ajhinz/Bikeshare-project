Prerequisites

1. Python - http://www.python.org
2. Django - http://www.djangoproject.com/
3. PostgreSQL - http://www.postgresql.org/
4. Apache - http://httpd.apache.org/


Notes:

For PostgreSQL, it's recommended that you create your own user
login (other than the default postgres user).  It may be easier to
make the user name the same as your operating system user name because
of the default permissions on who may log in from the host machine,
but it is not required.

Installation:

You must edit the settings.py file in the bike_project directory.  You
must set the database username and password.
